    <RememberAllieHeading>Courtney, Allie's school friend</RememberAllieHeading>
    <Paragraph>Allie was one of my best friends and having been lucky enough to
spend all my years at Channing with her, I have so many happy
memories that I will always cherish. Out of our close group of friends
Allie was the one who always seemed so much cooler and more grown
up, and would often come into school itching to tell us new gossip and
we would sit for hours in random nooks and crannies of the school
corridors and giggle as she updated us about her evolving love life. Allie
brought fun and laughter to even the most boring times at school. We
sat next to each other in Physics over our GCSE years, and the only
thing I remember about GCSE Physics is that we spent most of the
lessons making towers out of the 30 different lipbalms Allie kept in her
pencil case. Some of my favourite memories also involve Allie’s
birthday’s, where we would be whisked off for weekends camping in
yurts, treasure hunting around Dublin or being pampered on a spa day.
The overarching theme of all my memories with Allie is happiness and an
awful lot of laugher, and I miss her every day.</Paragraph>

    <RememberAllieHeading>Kitty, Allie's school friend</RememberAllieHeading>
    <Paragraph>As Allie was a ‘W’ and I am a ‘U’, Allie and I spent almost our whole
secondary school life in classes together. You could always hear her
giggle before she entered a room. Both of us also had a passion for
acting, so we often found ourselves backstage chatting away, laughing,
learning lines and talking about life - everything from school to boys to
the dreams we had of our creative futures. One year, we were in
Timberlake Wertenbaker’s adaptation of Cinderella, The Ash Girl, where
she played the titular part and I was her Prince Charming. Yes, we
would be silly and have our laughs, but when it came to the
performance she held herself with the kind of confidence and poise
that says ‘I got this.’ She always did. I loved performing with her; she
was so commanding on stage, no matter the part she played. I’ll never
forget her laugh, her beaming smile, her infectious energy and her
passion for life. She’ll always be my backstage pal.</Paragraph>

    <RememberAllieHeading>Bonnie, Allie's school friend</RememberAllieHeading>
    <Paragraph>Allie was, and is, one of my best friends. We met in Year 7 and I was
struck by how outgoing and smiley and friendly she was. Allie was neverfar from a laugh and she was my adventure partner. No ride in Thorpe
Park was too big for her. She was also an incredibly intelligent person
and oh boy did we have some big debates. While we can’t do these
things in person these memories are ever lasting and she is still with me
in these moments — when I want someone to appreciate a super scary
ride or film, an interesting article or just a good laugh. Love you and
miss you Allie.</Paragraph>

    Anna, Allie's school friend
    </RememberAllieHeading>
    <Paragraph>We did a Channing choir tour to Venice in 2009, I have so many fond
memories of us breaking into song on the public transport boats and at
the top of the bell tower in St Marks Square, doing full on renditions
of our latin choral pieces for everyone. I feel like there is a certain
level of confidence that being 16 and in a massive girl gang with all your
pals gives you, I would definitely not do that now! Allie had a beautiful
voice, there was a really special quality to it that meant you could
always hear her over everyone else in the choir, I have no idea what
the technical term is for that but you could always hear her. That trip
was hilarious all round, to touch on Allie's artistic prowess even more,was hilarious all round, to touch on Allie's artistic prowess even more,
one night us year 12 girls stayed in the hotel and Allie decided she was
going to do some makeovers. She got out this very bright eyeshadow
palette she had and gave me a very snazzy orange and green smokey
eye, it was very well executed and blended but I did look a bit mad, we
spent the rest of the evening chatting about rubbish and laughing A LOT.
The photos, videos and memories from that trip I will cherish forever.</Paragraph>

    Lydia, Allie's next-door neighbour
    </RememberAllieHeading>
    <Paragraph>Growing up next door to Allie with a close family bond, I spent much of
my childhood learning, playing and creating beside her. Though we often
fought like sisters - particularly over who got to hold her Mum's left
hand on the walk to school - we also had a wealth of joyful moments
together. There was no better pastime in my younger years than to
climb over our garden fence and jump for hours with Allie on her
treasured trampoline, chattering away as we bounced beside a
honeysuckle bush and two loyal dogs on her lawn</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Every week, Allie would come over for singing lessons with my Mum.
We bickered over who got to stand on the left side of the piano, ofcourse, but our voices always harmonised in song. One Sunday at
church, dressed in white frocks and feathery angel wings, we sang
Panis Angelicus in a perfect duet before an adoring congregation.
Allie was a truly angelic neighbour and her wisdom and kindness will
always be left with me.</Paragraph>

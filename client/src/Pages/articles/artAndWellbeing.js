                <TextImageTop alt={"Chalks"} mobile={true} src={'/assets/articles/artAndWellbeing/artAndWellbeing2.png'}/>
                <Paragraph>Studies have shown that the number of people struggling with stress and anxiety is at an all time high. As well as harming our mental and emotional wellbeing and impacting our enjoyment of life, stress can take a huge toll on our physical health, increasing the rik of developing heart disease, cancer and diabetes and lowering our life expectancy.</Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>Engaging in creative hobbies such as painting, drawing or pottery can help calm our nervous systems, reduce stress-inducing hormones like cortisol and put us in a place of ease and relaxation.

                <SubHeading>2. Releases emotions</SubHeading>
                <Paragraph>Emotional wellbeing is vital in our ability to create a happy and fulfilling life and contribute to society.</Paragraph>
                <TextImageTop alt={"Man playing guitar"} mobile={true} src={"/assets/articles/artAndWellbeing/artAndWellbeing3.png"}/>
                <Paragraph>We have all experienced emotional turmoil at some point in our lives. However, for many people, moving past these difficult experiences can be a struggle and their ability to cope with day-to-day life can be adversely affected. During challenging times and without adequate emotional resources or support, people often turn to unhealthy means of releasing or numbing their emotions - and in extreme cases this can lead to addiction or antisocial behaviour.</Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>Artistic activities such as writing, poetry or performing music are fantastic opportunities for people to feel, express and release tehir emotions in a safe, healthy and productive way. Not only is this incredibly cathartic but it can also lead to an overall improvement in emotional wellbeing through increased self-awareness and emotional regulation.</Paragraph>

                <Paragraph>
                Traumatic events such as childhood abuse and domestic violence are far more common than many people would like to believe. Motor accidents, divorce and the loss of a loved one can also push our ability to cope over the edge, leaving us with psychological scars that can affect us for the rest of our lives.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                Research by Dr Bessel Van Der Kolk, a leading expert in psychology and trauma, shows the vital role that movement, play and other forms of joyful engagement have in healing traumatic experiences. Art forms such as drama, dance and yoga are particularly effective at releasing and healing traumatic experiences held in the mind-body system.

                <Paragraph>During our childhood years, our cognitive development is at its peak. Studies show that engaging in artistic and creative activities is important for
children's cognitive growth, immensely improving their ability to think creatively and problem-solve throughout their lives. Participating in these activities during childhood can therefore have long-lasting benefits for people's wellbeing through developing their ability to overcome obstacles and excel in a range of careers.</Paragraph>

Art projects with people dealing with dementia and Alzheimer's disease have also proven the benefits of art for cognitive functioning later in life, showing a significant improvement in participants' memory recall and mental capacities.
